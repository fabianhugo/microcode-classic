title: Purchasing Hardware
---

## Portable programming

To run MicroCode (without a separate computer such as a laptop, desktop, tablet, smartphone) you need to get the following hardware:

-   a micro:bit V2, available from many [vendors](https://microbit.org/buy/)
-   a micro:bit [Arcade shield](#arcade-shields)

With the above hardware, in addition to the freely-available MicroCode software, you can also make use
of these other great programming environments:

-   [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org) for the micro:bit V2
-   [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com) for the micro:bit V2 + Arcade shield

## Tethered programming

If you only have a micro:bit V2, you can still use MicroCode, but you need to use the [web app](https://microsoft.github.io/microcode/) and connect your micro:bit using a micro-USB cable.

## KittenBot MicroCode product

KittenBot recently introduced a [MicroCode Explorer Kit](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/kittenbot-microcode-explorer-kit-computer-free-programming) that includes a micro:bit V2, newbit Arcade shield, Jacdac Kit A.

## Arcade Shields for the micro:bit V2

Three Arcade shields for the micro:bit V2 are available on the market today, as shown below:

 After downloading the MicroCode hex file to your micro:bit V2, whenever you plug the micro:bit into the Arcade Shield, MicroCode should start running. Your MicroCode program is always live and runnable. Once you remove the micro:bit from the shield, the program will persist and continue to run (assuming the micro:bit is still powered, of course).

## Jacdac and Robots

If you want to use [Jacdac](./jacdac) accessories with MicroCode, you will also need a kit of Jacdac modules (see [Jacdac Kit A](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/kittenbot/jacdacstarterkitawithjacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/), [Jacdac Kit B](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/kittenbot/jacdacdeveloperstoolelectronicmodulekitbv10/), [Climate Action Kit](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/forward-education/climateactionkitv10/)). If you further want to use MicroCode with a [supported micro:bit robot](./robots-supported.md), you will also need to purchase the robot, as well as an _additional micro:bit_ for slotting into the robot.

Both Jacdac and the micro:bit robots also are supported by [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org). For more info, see:

-   [Jacdac MakeCode integration](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/makecode/)
-   [MakeCode micro:bit robot extension](https://makecode.microbit.org/pkg/microsoft/microbit-robot)
